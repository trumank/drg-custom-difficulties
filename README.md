## [Hazard 5](difficulties/Hazard_5.cd.json)

## [Hazard 5 Carry](difficulties/Hazard_5_Carry.cd.json)
Hazard 5 with all properties that normally scale with player count fixed to 4 player values regardless of player count.

## [Hazard 5 - Praetorian Edition](difficulties/Hazard_5_Praetorian_Edition.cd.json)
Like the other version which replaces grunts with praetorians, but here we adjust the spawn cost to match grunts, increase the ideal spawn size from 3 to 6 and remove the maximum spawn size (was 4). I've also changed the rarity to 1, which is the lowest rarity present in the EnemyDescriptors and the rarity of grunts.

## [Hazard 5 - Praetorian Edition](difficulties/Hazard_5_Praetorian_Edition_v2.cd.json)
This is a demonstration custom difficulty that shows how to remove grunts and create a new praetorian descriptor that takes the place of grunts. The low rarity works like the grunt rarity in that it nearly guarantees praetorians get picked first for any spawns. A future version might demonstrate adjusting spawn costs and size to increase praetorian spawn counts.

## [Hazard 5x2, 60 Nitra](difficulties/Hazard_5x2_60_Nitra.cd.json)
Hazard 5, 2x enemies, 60 nitra resup cost

## [Hazard 5x2 50 Nitra Spicy Edition (Fire)](difficulties/Hazard_5x2_Spicy_Fire.cd.json)
This is for fans Hazard 5 with x2 enemies that are looking to add some spice, but don't want to jump to snorting Carolina Reapers in Hazard 6x2. The bugs are a little faster, a little stronger, a little beefier, and there are a few more of them. Variety is the spice of life and that's what you're getting here. With mild, you can expect enemy compositions familiar to Hazard 5 players. With Medium, your team will face more spitters, more bulks, more grabbers, generally more of the spicy enemies. With Hot, your team will face even more variety. You'll face unusual enemy compositions you've never seen before. For the truly adventurous there is Fire. With Fire, the game is free to go wild and you'll face true RNG. Diablo doesn't exist. V2

## [Hazard 5x2 50 Nitra Spicy Edition (Hot)](difficulties/Hazard_5x2_Spicy_Hot.cd.json)

## [Hazard 6](difficulties/Hazard_6.cd.json)
Imported from Ike's [Hazard 6 on Mod.io](https://drg.mod.io/ike)

## [Hazard 6x2 40 Nitra](difficulties/Hazard_6x2_40_Nitra.cd.json)
Hazard 6 with 2x enemy count, 40 nitra resupplies, and 180/180 spawn caps. Prospector and Data Vault disabled.

## [Hazard 6x2 60 Nitra](difficulties/Hazard_6x2_60_Nitra.cd.json)
Hazard 6x2, 60 nitra per resupply, typically used for EDDs.

## [Hazard 6x2 Diablo Edition](difficulties/Hazard_6x2_Diablo_Edition.cd.json)
The forbidden Spicy Edition. Enjoy at your own risk. Made by The Brain.

## [Hazard 6x2 - Diversity Edition](difficulties/Hazard_6x2_Diversity_Edition.cd.json)
This plays very similarly to normal Hazard 6x2. It's identical except that EnemeyDiversity is always the max. This results in very different enemy compositions. This variant can bring a little spice when Hazard 6x2 is feeling a little too same-y.

## [Hazard 6x2 Plus](difficulties/Hazard_6x2_Plus.cd.json)
Experimenting with adding some more enemy variants to otherwise normal hazard6x2. Currently only adds sentinels (for their aggressive digging which can disrupt otherwise comfortable positioning) and a fast but weak slasher. Subject to change.

## [Hazard 6x3 40 Nitra](difficulties/Hazard_6x3_40_Nitra.cd.json)
Hazard 6 with 3x enemy count, 40 nitra resupplies, and 180/180 spawn caps. Prospector and Data Vault disabled.

## [Hazard 7](difficulties/Hazard_7.cd.json)
Imported from Ike's [Hazard 7 on Mod.io](https://drg.mod.io/hazard-7)

## [Hazard 7x1.5, 50 Nitra](difficulties/Hazard_7x1.5_50_Nitra.cd.json)
Hazard 7, 1.5x enemies, 50 nitra resupplies

## [Hazard 7x2, 40 Nitra](difficulties/Hazard_7x2_40_Nitra.cd.json)
Hazard 7, 2x enemies, 40 nitra resupplies

## [Low Enemy Count](difficulties/Low_Enemy_Count.cd.json)
Not many bugs spawn. Difficult, but beatable.

## [Oops all bulks](difficulties/Oops_All_Bulks.cd.json)
This is a Custom Difficulty version of Milligin's "Oops all bulks" event he often plays on stream. It's usually played on a refinery mission, but other mission types could be interesting as well.

## [starship troopers INSANE](difficulties/Starship_Troopers_INSANE.cd.json)
Huge amounts of very fast enemies with very low hp, resups cost 40. Had no idea what I was doing and it's mostly a meme https://clips.twitch.tv/CogentGoodVultureVoteNay-2QOzDrdDH3kMOWyh

## [Starship Troopers Pro](difficulties/Starship_Troopers_Pro.cd.json)
FOR VETERANS OF THE STARSHIP TROOPERS ELITE MOD, this mod changes spawn size, so expect to be swimming in bugs if you don't kill fast enough. The enemies still have Haz4 specifications (speed*, damage, resistance, ..) as regular Starship Troopers. I don't recommend this mod for player level below 999, and even then I saw high level players rush in the middle of a new cave, die and make the mission fail as everybody risks their live or die in rescue attempts. This is easily comparable to Hazard 9 or Hazard 10.
